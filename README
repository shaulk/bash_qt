bash-Qt is a simple Qt wrapper for bash, written as a joke. DO NOT use this for
anything serious. It's probably full of bugs and security holes. I am not
responsible for any damage, deleted files, flipped bits, angry spouses or
anything else that may result from usage of bash-Qt. Seriously.

Requirements
------------
	bash
	Python 2.6 (may work on older versions)
	PyQt4 (developed against PyQt 4.7, will probably work with any 4.x)
All development and testing was done on Debian Squeeze, so if you're using
something else it might not work.

Files included
--------------
bash_qt.sh - This is the main bash-Qt module. Source this to use bash-Qt.
bash_qt_support.py - This a small Python program that wraps PyQt4, answers
	calls and sends signals to bash_qt.sh.
hello.sh - Simple Hello, World! program.
simple.sh - A slightly bigger example program.
